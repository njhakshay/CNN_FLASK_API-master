## **Plant Lead Disease Detection using Machine Learning**

A system which allows the user to upload image of a plant leaf and predict if it is disease affected;

#### Plants currently identified:
- Maize 
- Corn

### Machine Learning Model
 -  Used Convolution Neural Networks
 -  Used Tensorflow for builiding the CNN
 
### Rest API's Created
#### Used pickle to save the ML model and Flask to provide the Frontend as well the API's.
